Testing **code quality** isn’t one thing — it’s a **stack of checks** that tell you whether your code is correct, readable, maintainable, and safe to change.

Since you mostly work with **Vite + React + TypeScript / Node**, here’s a **clear, practical system** you can apply step-by-step.

---

## 1. Static Code Quality (before running the app)

These tools catch problems **without executing your code**.

### 1.1 Linting (code correctness + style)

**Purpose:** Catch bugs, bad patterns, inconsistent code.

Use:

* ESLint (JS/TS logic issues)
* TypeScript compiler (type safety)

What to check:

* Unused variables
* Incorrect dependencies in hooks
* Unsafe `any`
* Shadowed variables
* Missing returns

**Quality signal:**
If ESLint is clean → your code is structurally sound.

---

### 1.2 Formatting (readability)

**Purpose:** Make code easy to read and review.

Use:

* Prettier

Checks:

* Consistent indentation
* Line length
* Spacing
* Quotes

**Quality signal:**
If formatting is automatic → reviewers focus on logic, not style.

---

## 2. Unit Tests (logic correctness)

### 2.1 Test small units

**Purpose:** Verify individual functions/components behave correctly.

Test:

* Utility functions
* Reducers
* Validation logic
* Business rules

Example checks:

* Given input X → output must be Y
* Edge cases (empty, null, invalid)

**Quality signal:**
If a small change breaks a test → your test is valuable.

---

## 3. Component & UI Tests (React)

### 3.1 Component behavior

**Purpose:** Ensure UI behaves as expected.

Test:

* Rendering without crashing
* Props affect output
* Buttons trigger actions
* Conditional rendering

Questions to ask:

* Does the component render with minimal props?
* Does it break when data is missing?

**Quality signal:**
If refactoring UI doesn’t break behavior → good test coverage.

---

## 4. Integration Tests (systems working together)

**Purpose:** Check multiple parts working as a unit.

Test flows like:

* Form → validation → submit
* Login → token → protected route
* API call → state update → UI update

**Quality signal:**
If real user flows work in tests → system is reliable.

---

## 5. Runtime Quality (when app is running)

### 5.1 Error handling

Check:

* Try/catch around async logic
* API failures handled gracefully
* No silent failures

Ask:

* What happens if the backend is down?
* What happens if data is malformed?

---

### 5.2 Logging

Good quality code:

* Logs errors meaningfully
* Avoids noisy console logs
* Distinguishes info vs error

---

## 6. Maintainability Checks (long-term quality)

Ask yourself these questions:

* Can another developer understand this in 5 minutes?
* Are functions small and focused?
* Are names descriptive?
* Is logic duplicated?
* Can I delete or change code safely?

**Rule of thumb:**
If you’re afraid to touch a file → quality is low.

---

## 7. Performance & Complexity

Check:

* Unnecessary re-renders
* Expensive loops in render
* Over-fetching data
* Large components doing too much

Tools:

* React DevTools Profiler
* Simple console timing

---

## 8. Test Coverage (but don’t worship it)

Coverage answers:

* “Which code is never tested?”

But remember:

* 60% good tests > 95% useless tests

**Quality signal:**
Critical logic is tested, not every line.

---

## 9. Code Review (even solo)

Do a **self-review checklist**:

* Would I accept this in a production codebase?
* Is this the simplest solution?
* Is this consistent with the rest of the project?

Bonus:

* Read code **after 24 hours**
* If it feels confusing → refactor

---

## 10. Minimal Quality Stack (recommended)

If you want a **clean, non-overkill setup**:

1. TypeScript (strict)
2. ESLint
3. Prettier
4. Unit tests for logic
5. Integration tests for core flows

That’s already **professional-grade quality**.

---

### If you want next

I can:

* Design a **code quality checklist** you reuse per project
* Suggest **exact tooling setup** for your current repo
* Help you classify files into **simple / medium / complex testing levels**

Just tell me which one.

Perfect 👍
We’ll do this **step-by-step, one after the other**, clean and reusable.

We’ll start with **(1) a reusable Code Quality Checklist**.
After that, we’ll move to **(2) exact tooling setup**, then **(3) simple → medium → complex testing levels**.

---

# PART 1 — REUSABLE CODE QUALITY CHECKLIST

You can use this **for every project**, and even **per file** before committing code.

No tools yet — just **thinking discipline**.

---

## A. FILE-LEVEL QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before you say a file is “done”, check:

1. File has **one clear responsibility**
2. File name matches what it does
3. No commented-out dead code
4. No unused imports or variables
5. Functions are short (ideally < 30–40 lines)
6. No magic numbers or strings without meaning
7. Logic is readable without comments
8. Error cases are handled
9. Async code has try/catch or error boundaries
10. File can be changed without breaking unrelated parts

If you fail **3+ items**, refactor before moving on.

---

## B. FUNCTION-LEVEL QUALITY CHECKLIST

For every function:

1. Function name explains **what** it does, not **how**
2. Inputs are clear and minimal
3. Output type is predictable
4. Function does one thing only
5. No hidden side effects
6. No duplicated logic from elsewhere
7. Edge cases considered (empty, null, invalid)
8. No unnecessary parameters
9. Return early instead of deep nesting
10. Easy to unit test

Rule:
If a function needs a long comment → it’s too complex.

---

## C. REACT COMPONENT QUALITY CHECKLIST

For each component:

1. Component has **single responsibility**
2. Props are typed strictly
3. State is minimal
4. Side effects are isolated in hooks
5. No business logic inside JSX
6. Conditional rendering is readable
7. No prop drilling abuse
8. Reusable logic extracted into hooks
9. Handles loading and error states
10. Component can render with empty data

Red flag:
If a component exceeds ~200 lines → split it.

---

## D. PROJECT-LEVEL QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before calling the project “stable”:

1. Linting passes with zero errors
2. Formatting is consistent
3. Core logic has tests
4. Critical flows are tested
5. Errors are logged meaningfully
6. No hardcoded secrets
7. Environment variables are validated
8. Folder structure is consistent
9. Dependencies are minimal
10. You’re not afraid to refactor

---

## E. QUALITY CONFIDENCE SCORE (Simple but powerful)

After finishing a feature, score it:

* Readability: /10
* Safety (errors handled): /10
* Testability: /10
* Maintainability: /10

If total < 30 → refactor
If ≥ 35 → ship

---

## F. WHEN TO STOP IMPROVING

Stop improving when:

* The next change doesn’t reduce risk
* Tests already catch likely failures
* Code is obvious to a new developer

Perfection ≠ quality.

---

### ✅ PART 1 DONE

You now have a **mental and procedural quality gate** that works even without tools.

---

## NEXT: PART 2 — EXACT TOOLING SETUP

In the next message, I’ll:

* Give **exact tools**
* Minimal configs
* Where each tool fits in your workflow
* No over-engineering

I’ll start with **TypeScript + ESLint + Prettier** and move upward.

Say **“continue to part 2”** when ready.

Great — let’s continue cleanly 👍
This is **PART 2: Exact Tooling Setup**.

Goal: **professional-grade code quality** with **minimum complexity**.

---

# PART 2 — EXACT TOOLING SETUP (NO OVERKILL)

This setup works for:

* Vite + React
* TypeScript
* Node / backend
* Scales from solo → team → production

---

## 1. TYPE SAFETY (FOUNDATION)

### 1.1 Enable strict TypeScript

**Why:** Catches bugs before runtime.

In `tsconfig.json`:

* strict typing enabled
* no implicit `any`
* unused locals flagged
* unreachable code flagged

Quality effect:

* Forces you to think clearly
* Makes refactoring safe

Rule:
If TypeScript complains, **fix the code**, don’t silence it.

---

## 2. ESLINT (LOGIC & CODE SMELLS)

### 2.1 What ESLint gives you

It catches:

* Bugs
* Bad patterns
* React hook mistakes
* Unused variables
* Unsafe async logic

Think of ESLint as your **second brain**.

---

### 2.2 ESLint minimal stack (recommended)

Use:

* ESLint core
* TypeScript ESLint
* React + Hooks rules

Core rule philosophy:

* Errors for bugs
* Warnings for style
* No noisy rules

Quality effect:

* Prevents “clever but dangerous” code
* Enforces consistency

---

### 2.3 ESLint workflow

Run:

* On save (editor)
* Before commit
* Before deployment

Rule:
If lint fails → code is not done.

---

## 3. PRETTIER (READABILITY)

### 3.1 Why Prettier matters

Prettier:

* Removes style debates
* Makes diffs readable
* Speeds up reviews

Never mix:

* Manual formatting
* Multiple formatters

Prettier is the **single source of truth** for formatting.

---

### 3.2 Formatting philosophy

Let Prettier decide:

* Indentation
* Line breaks
* Quotes

You decide:

* Naming
* Structure
* Architecture

---

## 4. TEST RUNNER (FOUNDATION FOR TESTS)

### 4.1 One test runner only

Choose **one** and use it everywhere.

Recommended:

* Frontend: fast, TypeScript-friendly
* Backend: same runner if possible

Why:

* Shared mental model
* Shared config
* Less friction

---

## 5. BASIC TEST TYPES TO ENABLE NOW

Even before writing many tests, enable:

1. Unit test support
2. Coverage reporting
3. Watch mode
4. CI-compatible run mode

You don’t need:

* Snapshot obsession
* Complex mocks
* End-to-end yet

---

## 6. GIT HOOKS (QUALITY ENFORCEMENT)

### 6.1 What to block before commit

Before any commit:

1. Lint must pass
2. Type check must pass
3. Tests must pass (or critical ones)

This prevents:

* Broken main branch
* “Fix later” culture

---

## 7. SIMPLE QUALITY PIPELINE (LOCAL)

Your daily workflow becomes:

1. Write code
2. TypeScript checks
3. ESLint checks
4. Prettier formats
5. Tests validate
6. Commit

If step 3 fails → don’t move forward.

---

## 8. WHAT NOT TO ADD (YET)

Avoid for now:

* Heavy static analysis tools
* Overly strict lint rules
* Complex CI pipelines
* Mutation testing

These are **stage-2 tools**, not foundations.

---

## 9. TOOLING QUALITY SCORECARD

Your tooling setup is correct if:

* Type errors are rare
* Lint errors feel meaningful
* Formatting is automatic
* Tests fail when logic breaks
* You trust refactoring

If tooling feels annoying → simplify rules.

---

## 10. COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. Turning off lint rules instead of fixing code
2. Chasing 100% coverage
3. Testing UI details instead of behavior
4. Ignoring warnings
5. Adding tools you don’t understand

---

### ✅ PART 2 DONE

You now have:

* A **clean quality tool stack**
* A **repeatable workflow**
* A **scalable foundation**

---

## NEXT: PART 3 — SIMPLE → MEDIUM → COMPLEX TESTING LEVELS

Next, I’ll:

* Classify files by complexity
* Tell you **what to test and what not to test**
* Show how testing evolves as the project grows

Say **“continue to part 3”** when ready.

Excellent call 👍
That’s the **right time** to introduce Python — before we lock in testing levels.

I’ll **update the mental model and tooling philosophy** so **Node/Express and Python live together cleanly**, without duplicating effort.

No code yet — just **architecture + quality alignment**.

---

# ADDING PYTHON INTO YOUR CODE QUALITY SYSTEM

You’re now working with a **polyglot stack**:

* Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript
* Backend(s):

  * Node / Express (JavaScript / TypeScript)
  * Python (APIs, data, automation, ML, services)

The goal is **one quality mindset**, not two separate worlds.

---

## 1. ONE QUALITY PHILOSOPHY, MULTIPLE LANGUAGES

Regardless of language, quality means:

1. Predictable behavior
2. Clear structure
3. Safe refactoring
4. Easy testing
5. Low cognitive load

So we map **equivalent tools**, not different rules.

---

## 2. TOOL EQUIVALENCE MAP (VERY IMPORTANT)

This keeps your brain consistent.

| Purpose        | JS / TS       | Python              |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Type safety    | TypeScript    | Type hints (typing) |
| Linting        | ESLint        | Ruff / Flake8       |
| Formatting     | Prettier      | Black               |
| Import sorting | ESLint rules  | isort               |
| Testing        | Vitest / Jest | pytest              |
| Coverage       | c8            | pytest-cov          |
| Env validation | zod           | pydantic            |
| Static checks  | tsc           | mypy                |
| Pre-commit     | husky         | pre-commit          |

**Key insight:**
Different tools, **same guarantees**.

---

## 3. PYTHON QUALITY FOUNDATION (MENTAL, NOT CODE)

Before writing Python seriously, adopt these rules:

### 3.1 Type everything important

* Function inputs
* Return values
* Public APIs
* Data models

Untyped Python = JavaScript without TypeScript.

---

### 3.2 No “script chaos”

Avoid:

* Giant `main.py`
* Logic at import time
* Side effects everywhere

Prefer:

* `services/`
* `domain/`
* `utils/`

Same discipline as backend Node.

---

## 4. PYTHON PROJECT STRUCTURE (QUALITY-ORIENTED)

Basic, clean structure:

* app/

  * main.py (entry)
  * api/
  * services/
  * domain/
  * models/
  * utils/
* tests/
* pyproject.toml

Quality effect:

* Easy testing
* Clear boundaries
* Safe refactoring

---

## 5. ERROR HANDLING MINDSET (IMPORTANT)

In Python:

* Raise meaningful exceptions
* Catch them at boundaries
* Don’t swallow errors

Same as:

* `throw` in JS
* `try/catch` in Node

---

## 6. PYTHON TESTING PHILOSOPHY (ALIGN WITH JS)

Same questions apply:

* What breaks if this changes?
* What logic is critical?
* What flows must never fail?

Avoid:

* Testing print statements
* Testing private internals
* Testing framework behavior

Test:

* Business logic
* Data transformations
* Edge cases

---

## 7. PYTHON + NODE COEXISTENCE RULES

If both exist in one system:

1. Define **clear ownership**

   * Node = real-time, sockets, auth, frontend-facing
   * Python = data, computation, pipelines, ML, background tasks

2. Communicate via:

   * HTTP APIs
   * Message queues
   * Jobs

Never mix logic across languages randomly.

---

## 8. SHARED QUALITY GATES (CRITICAL)

Before merging code (any language):

* Lint passes
* Types pass
* Tests pass
* Formatting clean

Language doesn’t matter — **rules do**.

---

## 9. COMMON PYTHON QUALITY MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. Skipping type hints
2. Using dynamic dicts everywhere
3. Writing logic at module import
4. Catching `Exception` blindly
5. No tests because “Python is flexible”

Flexibility ≠ safety.

---

## 10. UPDATED ROADMAP CONFIRMATION

Now your roadmap is:

1. Quality checklist ✅
2. Tooling setup (JS + Python aligned) ✅
3. Testing levels (Simple → Medium → Complex) ⏭️ NEXT

This ensures:

* You don’t duplicate thinking
* You don’t lower quality in Python
* You scale cleanly

---

### Ready for PART 3

Next, I’ll classify **testing levels** for:

* Frontend (React)
* Backend (Node)
* Backend (Python)

Very practical, file-by-file guidance.

When you’re ready, say:
**“continue to part 3”**

Excellent.
This is the most **practical part** — once you understand this, you’ll never feel confused about *what to test* again.

---

# PART 3 — SIMPLE → MEDIUM → COMPLEX TESTING LEVELS

*(Unified for React + Node + Python)*

The core idea:

> **Not all files deserve the same level of testing**

We classify **files**, not projects.

---

## LEVEL 1 — SIMPLE (LOW RISK, LOW COST)

### What this level is

* Pure logic
* Deterministic
* No I/O
* No framework dependency

These are the **cheapest tests** and should be tested first.

---

### Files that belong here

**Frontend (React / TS)**

* `utils/`
* `helpers/`
* formatters
* validators
* constants logic
* pure hooks without side effects

**Node / Express**

* utility functions
* pure services
* data mappers
* validation logic

**Python**

* utility functions
* pure services
* data transformers
* calculations
* parsers

---

### What to test

1. Input → output
2. Edge cases
3. Invalid input
4. Boundary values

No mocks. No DOM. No server.

---

### Example thinking

> “If I change this logic, will something break silently?”

If yes → Level 1 test.

---

### Quality rule

* High coverage
* Fast tests
* Run constantly

This is your **safety net**.

---

## LEVEL 2 — MEDIUM (INTEGRATION & BEHAVIOR)

### What this level is

* Multiple units working together
* Some framework involvement
* Still controlled

This is where **real bugs usually live**.

---

### Files that belong here

**Frontend**

* React components
* Custom hooks with effects
* Forms
* State management logic

**Node**

* Controllers
* Services touching DB (mocked)
* Auth logic
* Middleware

**Python**

* API routes
* Services calling other services
* DB access (mocked)
* Background jobs

---

### What to test

1. Correct behavior
2. State changes
3. Error handling
4. Conditional flows

Mock:

* Network
* DB
* External services

Don’t mock:

* Your own logic

---

### Example thinking

> “Does this behave correctly from the user’s perspective?”

If yes → Level 2 test.

---

### Quality rule

* Focus on behavior, not implementation
* Fewer tests than Level 1
* Still fast enough to run locally

---

## LEVEL 3 — COMPLEX (CRITICAL FLOWS)

### What this level is

* End-to-end behavior
* Real integrations
* High cost, high value

These tests protect **business survival**.

---

### Files / flows that belong here

**Frontend**

* Login flow
* Payment flow
* Onboarding flow
* Multi-step forms

**Backend (Node + Python)**

* Auth lifecycle
* Transaction pipelines
* Data processing pipelines
* Cross-service communication

---

### What to test

1. Full user journeys
2. Real environment behavior
3. Failure scenarios
4. Data integrity

Minimal mocking.
Real APIs where possible.

---

### Example thinking

> “If this breaks in production, do we lose money or trust?”

If yes → Level 3 test.

---

### Quality rule

* Few tests
* Run in CI
* Stable, not flaky

---

## VISUAL SUMMARY

```
LEVEL 1 — Logic correctness (many tests)
LEVEL 2 — Behavior correctness (some tests)
LEVEL 3 — Business safety (few tests)
```

---

## HOW THIS APPLIES TO PYTHON SPECIFICALLY

### Python Level 1

* Data transformations
* Calculations
* Parsing
* Validation

### Python Level 2

* FastAPI / Flask endpoints
* Service-to-service calls
* Job handlers

### Python Level 3

* Data pipelines
* Model inference pipelines
* Long-running workflows
* External API integrations

---

## HOW TO DECIDE TEST LEVEL (FAST CHECK)

Ask 3 questions:

1. Is it pure logic? → Level 1
2. Does it involve framework or I/O? → Level 2
3. Does it protect money, trust, or uptime? → Level 3

---

## COMMON TESTING MISTAKES (AVOID THESE)

1. Writing Level 3 tests too early
2. Testing implementation details
3. Mocking everything
4. Skipping Level 1 tests
5. Chasing coverage numbers

---

## YOUR IDEAL TEST DISTRIBUTION

* 60–70% Level 1
* 20–30% Level 2
* 5–10% Level 3

This gives:

* Speed
* Confidence
* Scalability

---

## FINAL QUALITY LOOP (FULL SYSTEM)

1. Code written
2. Type checks pass
3. Lint passes
4. Level 1 tests pass
5. Level 2 tests pass
6. Level 3 tests protect core flows
7. Confident deployment

---

### You now have a COMPLETE CODE QUALITY SYSTEM

You can:

* Judge any file’s quality
* Decide what to test
* Scale across JS, TS, and Python
* Avoid over-testing and under-testing

---

If you want next, I can:

* Map **your current project files** into Level 1/2/3
* Create a **testing checklist per level**
* Design a **monorepo quality setup (JS + Python)**

Just tell me which one you want next.
